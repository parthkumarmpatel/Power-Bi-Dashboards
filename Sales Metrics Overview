## 1. Core Metrics (from Sales fact table)

- **Total Revenue**, **Quantity Sold**, **Order Count**, **Profit** ‚Äì these are your essentials.  
- **Track Sales Growth** (YoY/MoM) to see trends.  
- **Average Order Value / Deal Size** (`Revenue √∑ Order Count`) shows transaction quality.

## üõ†Ô∏è Putting It All Together in Power‚ÄØBI

- Model your star schema: link Sales (fact) to Customer & Product (dimension) tables.  
- Build visuals: bar charts for top 10 products, line charts for monthly growth, tables of repeat customers.  
- Create KPIs with thresholds (e.g., conversion rate goal, revenue growth target).  
- Add filters/slicers: allow toggling by customer segment, product line, or time period.  
- Offer both high-level dashboards and drill-through details (e.g., click a product to see its customer breakdown).
